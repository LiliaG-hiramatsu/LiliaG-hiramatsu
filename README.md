# Lilia Andrea GarcÃ­a Hiramatsu

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Lilo.

ðŸŽ“ I'm a 29-year-old student based in Mendoza, Argentina, currently wrapping up my fourth year of studies in Mechatronics Engineering at the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo. On the side, I'm also diving into the world of software development through the Software Development Technology program at the Instituto TecnolÃ³gico Universitario.

ðŸ’¼ By day, you'll find me at a Mendoza-based software development company, where I wear multiple hats â€“ from providing help desk support to whipping up virtual stores using Wordpress.

ðŸš€ I'm passionate about continuous learning. In 2023, I had the chance to participate in an intensive Full Stack MERN bootcamp organized by Mindhub LA, thanks to the Argentina Program 4.0 initiative. It was an eye-opening experience that expanded my skills and perspective on web development.

ðŸ’» Curious to see what I've been working on? Check out some of my projects on my portfolio: [Portfolio](https://portfolio-lilia-garcia.vercel.app/)

ðŸŒŸ I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out â€“ let's chat about tech, engineering, or anything else that sparks your interest!
